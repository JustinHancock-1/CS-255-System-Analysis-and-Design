# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design
# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company that helps instruct new drivers how to pass their driving exams. They wanted to design a system that would allow customers to purchase packages, access their study materials, schedule in person driving appointments, and take practice exams through a website.

# What did you do particularly well?

The design for this project is pretty straight forward. I think keeping things simple in the design is best for this system, and I think I was able to do that well. Projects can become overcomplicated very quickly if you let too many things distract you from the end goal that the client wants. I focused on their needs and met them.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think there are more details that can be added to further document things that will need to be thought about and discussed within the system. I may not have everything needed in the documents for this project, but as a starting point in the development process, I think these documents are sufficient with room to grow and develop with the project as we build it.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

You have to listen and understand the approach that a client brings to the table for their system. Their idea may not always be the most efficient especially when designing the program, but it's our responsibility to understand the needs that they have and find a way to meet them. We are able to take their needs and develop them further into a program that not only checks the boxes for them but gives the user an interface that is simple and easy to use.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I really enjoyed the creation of diagrams in this course. In previous courses, I have developed some class diagrams, but the activity, sequence, and case diagrams in this course made a lot of sense to me, and I will definitely carry those strategies forward in future projects. Being able to understand a process and visually see the process and detail of a system gives clarity to the team for the development of the project.
